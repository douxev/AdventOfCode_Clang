# Advent Of Code 
Here are my source files used to solve problems from [https://adventofcode.com/2022/](Advent of Code) 2022 Edition .
I decided to try C lang to get my hands on this low level programming language, trying to figure out how to manage memory and things I do not master yet.
This is part of my professionnal retraining.
As such, my goal is now to enter 42 School and learn the basics to progress faster when I begin school.
